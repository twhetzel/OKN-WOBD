# Template for graph metadata YAML files
# Copy this file to {graph-shortname}.yaml and fill in the values
#
# This metadata is merged into the auto-generated {graph}_global.json by build_graph_context.py
# Fields marked "optional" can be omitted if not applicable

# Required: Graph shortname (must match the filename: {id}.yaml)
id: graph-shortname

# Required: SPARQL endpoint URL
# For FRINK graphs: https://frink.apps.renci.org/{shortname}/sparql
# For external graphs: the actual SPARQL endpoint URL
endpoint: "https://frink.apps.renci.org/graph-shortname/sparql"

# Optional: Human-readable description
# If omitted, build_graph_context.py will derive a description from the graph introspection
# If provided, this overrides the auto-generated description
description: "Brief description of what this graph contains and what it's good for"

# Required: Use cases this graph supports
# Common values: "dataset_search", "entity_lookup", "entity_relationships", "ontology_reasoning"
# Multiple values allowed
good_for:
  - "dataset_search"
  # - "entity_lookup"

# Optional: Ontologies provided by this graph (e.g. MONDO, GO, HP, NCBITaxon)
# Only include if the graph is a source/authority for these ontologies
provides_ontologies:
  - "MONDO"
  # - "GO"

# Optional: Notable relationship patterns in this graph
# Describe key relationship types that users should know about
# Format: "Subject to object via predicate (description)"
notable_relationships:
  - "Datasets to diseases via schema:healthCondition (MONDO IRIs)"
  - "Datasets to species via schema:species (UniProt taxonomy IRIs)"
  # Add more relationship patterns...

# Optional: Example predicates with brief descriptions
# List important predicates users should know about
# Format: "prefix:property (human-readable description)"
# You can extract candidates from the *_global.json file's top properties
example_predicates:
  - "schema:healthCondition (links to disease entities)"
  - "schema:species (links to species/organism entities)"
  # Add more predicates from the graph...

# Optional: Entity types that can be used to query this graph
# Maps entity types to the properties used to query them
queryable_by:
  - entity_type: "Disease"
    property: "schema:healthCondition"
  - entity_type: "Species"
    property: "schema:species"
  # Add more queryable entity types...
