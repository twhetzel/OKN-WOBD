## WOBD Web (Streamlit NL→SPARQL interface)

This subproject provides a Streamlit-based web UI for the OKN-WOBD project.
It turns natural-language questions into SPARQL queries against configured
SPARQL endpoints (e.g. NDE datasets in FRINK and gene expression sources).

The app is **config-driven**: all endpoint URLs and LLM settings live in YAML
config files under `web/configs/`, selected via the `WOBD_CONFIG_PATH`
environment variable.

---

## Local development quickstart

### 1. Activate the project virtual environment

From the repo root, reuse the `.venv` created as described in the main
`README.md`:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies for the web app

Still from the repo root:

```bash
pip install -e ./web
```

This installs the `wobd-web` package with its dependencies (Streamlit, OpenAI
client, etc.).

### 3. Set your OpenAI API key

The NL→SPARQL component uses OpenAI (model `gpt-4.1` by default):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."  # replace with your key
```

### 4. Run the app (local GraphDB / RDF mode, “Mode B”)

By default, if `WOBD_CONFIG_PATH` is not set, the app uses
`web/configs/demo.local.yaml`, which expects a local SPARQL endpoint at:

- `http://localhost:7200/repositories/nde` (NDE)
- `http://localhost:7200/repositories/geneexpr` (gene expression, optional)

To start the app:

```bash
streamlit run web/app.py
```

Then open the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:8501`).

## Running with a local GraphDB instance (Mode B)

To back the demo with RDF triples loaded locally, you can run GraphDB via
Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name graphdb \
  -p 7200:7200 \
  ontotext/graphdb:latest
```

Then:

1. Open `http://localhost:7200` in your browser.
2. Create a repository with ID `nde`.
3. (Optional) Create another repository with ID `geneexpr` for gene expression.
4. Import your RDF files into those repositories via the GraphDB UI.

Once loaded, `demo.local.yaml` will point the web app at these local
repositories.

---

## Running against remote FRINK / production endpoints (Mode A)

To run the app against remote graph endpoints (e.g., FRINK, hosted NDE), use
`web/configs/demo.yaml` or your own config file pointing at the desired
SPARQL URLs.

Example (edit the URLs to match your deployment):

```yaml
sources:
  nde:
    endpoints:
      - id: nde-frink
        label: "NDE via FRINK"
        sparql_url: "https://frink.example.org/nde/sparql"

  frink:
    endpoints:
      - id: frink-main
        label: "FRINK"
        sparql_url: "https://frink.example.org/sparql"
```

Run the app with:

```bash
export WOBD_CONFIG_PATH=web/configs/demo.yaml
streamlit run web/app.py
```

You can create additional YAML configs (e.g., `prod.yaml`, `staging.yaml`) and
select among them by changing `WOBD_CONFIG_PATH`.

## Deployment to Streamlit Community Cloud

The web app can be deployed to Streamlit Community Cloud. The deployment uses `web/pyproject.toml` (PEP 621 format with setuptools) for dependency management.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Connect your repository** to Streamlit Community Cloud
2. **Configure app settings**:
   - **Main file**: `web/app.py`
   - **Python version**: 3.11 or higher
3. **Set secrets in Streamlit** (App Settings → Secrets):
   ```toml
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your-api-key-here"
   WOBD_CONFIG_PATH = "web/configs/demo.yaml"  # Optional: defaults to demo.yaml if not set
   ```
4. **Dependencies**: Streamlit Cloud will automatically install dependencies from `web/pyproject.toml`

The app will use `web/configs/demo.yaml` by default. To use a different config file, set `WOBD_CONFIG_PATH` in Streamlit secrets (as shown above) or as an environment variable in the Streamlit Cloud settings.

## UI overview

- **Sidebar**
  - Toggles for **Show generated SPARQL** and **Show provenance**.
  - Toggle **Apply query limit** - controls whether query results are limited to `max_rows` (from config, default: 200). Uncheck to get all results.
  - A list of example questions that pre-fill the main input.
- **Main area**
  - Chat-like history of questions and answers.
  - Latest answer summary text.
  - Tabs per source (e.g., `nde`, `gene_expression`) showing result
    tables.
  - Optional expanders for generated SPARQL and provenance.
  - Info message when query limits are applied (with instructions on how to disable).

### Query Limits

By default, query results are limited to `max_rows` (configured in YAML, default: 200) for **NL→SPARQL queries** to ensure fast response times. **Preset queries** (example questions) do not have limits applied as they are trusted and optimized.

You can disable query limits in two ways:

1. **Sidebar toggle**: Uncheck "Apply query limit" in the sidebar before submitting your question.
2. **Keywords in question**: Include any of these keywords in your question:
   - "all results"
   - "no limit"
   - "remove limit"
   - "unlimited"
   - "show all"

When limits are applied, an info message will appear in the results indicating the limit value and how to disable it.

All endpoint URLs and LLM settings are controlled via YAML config files and can
be switched without modifying application code.
